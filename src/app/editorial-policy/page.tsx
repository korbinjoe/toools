  { title: "Prefer primary sources", text: "For capability, deployment, pricing, and licensing claims, use provider documentation, official pricing pages, and the project's repository or license. A maker submission or imported directory listing is a lead for review, not independent verification." },
  { title: "Separate facts from recommendations", text: "Capability summaries cite their documentation. “When to choose” guidance is an editorial judgment about a task and its constraints. A recommendation is not a benchmark or a promise of results. Hands-on findings should only be labeled as such when the test and its conditions are recorded." },
  { title: "Explain the decision criteria", text: "Evaluate task fit, deployment requirements, maintenance work, data portability, licensing, and cost at intended usage. A tool's stars, votes, or visits are popularity signals; they do not establish quality or suitability." },
  { title: "Make alternatives meaningful", text: "Curated alternatives explain the need each option addresses. Automatically selected products from the same category are labeled as more tools in that category, rather than equivalent replacements." },
  { title: "Use dates honestly", text: "A documentation review date identifies the reference review for that guidance. It does not imply a full product test or continuous monitoring. Visits and outbound clicks are activity counters, not content updates. When no reliable content modification date exists, the sitemap omits it." },
  { title: "Treat prices and licenses as conditions", text: "Check current prices and terms at the provider. A free allowance can differ from production cost, and source-available software is not automatically open source. Where a guide does not verify an exact amount, it uses budgeting questions rather than a fixed total." },
  { title: "Disclose commercial influence", text: "Any paid placement, affiliate relationship, or sponsored recommendation should be disclosed on the affected content. A featured badge indicates an editorial selection and does not by itself substantiate a performance claim." },
